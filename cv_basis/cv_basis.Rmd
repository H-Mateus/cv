# Professional Overview

Experienced bioinformtician with a strong track record in the field of spinal cord injury and Alzheimer's disease.
Extremely adaptable with a highly interdisciplinary background of bench work, proteomics, genomics and bioinformatics.
Accomplished in working with diverse teams, including clinical and patient-facing settings.
My leadership with informatic colleagues in working more cohesively and reproducibly by promoting the use of version control, containerisation and continuous integrations has streamlined our projects, reduced errors and improved quality.
Related experience in training colleagues in the use of tools such as Git, GitHub/GitLab, R Markdown/Quarto and Docker.
